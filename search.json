Something to remember is that music is inherently perceptual and any study of the structure of music should keep this in mind. One can classify and describe music in a variety of valid ways. One can consider the cultural impact of the music (think of the Beatles), the perception of the artist, the physical medium that we buy (record, CD, file, with its associated art and meta-data), or the raw audio file itself. Considering any category in isolation may provide incomplete information on what exactly we consider that piece of music to be. I chose to look at the raw audio and analyze it because the act of listening is when we notice music’s structure."

    "text": "Ideas\nEven when looking at the raw audio, there are a variety of approaches. One can distill the audio file into a long list of statistics (average energy, zero crossing rate, the distribution of the frequencies, etc.), look at its structural makeup (i.e. ABACABA form; Bridge, Verse, Chorus), or use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequencies. I decided to use the FFT to describe the song because the spectrum at a given time provides a lot of information and we can scaffold other methods on top of this initial analysis.\n\n\n\nDifferent types of methods for analyzing audio data\n\n\nI broke the audio into overlapping windows, or frames, as they are called (see below). There are standards for the size of the frames and the amount of overlap between frames (See Music Similarity and Retrieval). When you look at a frame of the audio file, it’s important to apply a Hamming filter, which forces the sample to be periodic, no matter where the frame starts or stops. This is needed to get rid of artifacts in the FFT computation, however, it removes information at the beginning and end of the frame, which is why overlap (“hop” in standard terminology) between frames is a best practice.\n\n\n\nOverview for how I parsed through each audio file\n\n\nRecall that music is inherently a perceptual medium and so, we, as humans, do not perceive sound absolutely, but rather, relatively. The mel scale was developed to captured to account for the non-linear way in which we perceive relative pitch and the sone and phon scales capture how we perceive loudness depending on the pitch.\n\n\n\nRelative scales for pitch and loudness\n\n\nFrom the frequency spectrum that I computed for each frame, I computed the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) which are defined most simply as the frequency of the log frequencies relative to the Mel scale described above. Here’s a visual of the process of computing MFCCs:\n\n\n\nProcess (Steps 1-5) for computing the MFCCs of a frame"

Oftentimes, processes like cold rolling, milling, stamping, forging, etc. are used not only to achieve the desired shape, but also the desired strength. Desirable traits could be stiffness, high fatigue strength, flexibility, or other application specific characteristics. Microstructure Sensitive Design (MSD) is the process by which you achieve material properties by a sequence of forming operations. Unfortunately, metal forming simulations that account for and keep track of the microstructure are extremely computationally expensive, so typically, simulations are run on extremely small “samples”.

    "section": "",
    "text": "An illustration of a 3-uniform hypergraph sampled from the HPPM model with varying strengths of community structure using XGI.\n\n\nI’m excited to belatedly announce that “Polarization in hypergraphs with community structure”, a collaboration with Juan G. Restrepo, is on arXiv! This project started almost by accident. We wanted to see whether community structure was affecting the epidemic threshold or the onset of tipping point behavior for the hypergraph SIS model. In our investigation, we found a very interesting phase diagram.\n\n\n\nA phase plot of the mean-field equations with \\epsilon_2 = 0.5, \\widetilde{\\beta}_2 = 0.2, and \\widetilde{\\beta}_3 = 4 for three different values of \\widetilde{\\epsilon}_3. These plots illustrate the cases where there are no asymmetric fixed points (\\epsilon_3=0.75), only unstable asymmetric fixed points (\\epsilon_3=0.85), and stable asymmetric fixed points (\\epsilon_3=0.95). The filled circles correspond to stable fixed points and the open circles correspond to unstable fixed points.\n\n\nThis phase diagram shows that two different communities can have very different stable equilibria for strong enough community structure and we defined the “polarization” as the maximum distance between two communities’ stable fixed points. We investigated the infectious and structural parameters for which polarization exists. We concluded that polarization occurs below the epidemic threshold for sufficient higher-order infectiousness and is very sensitive to higher-order community structure.\n\n\n\nThe polarization with respect to community structure (first row) and infectiousness (second row). Note the different ranges of \\epsilon_2 and \\epsilon_3 in panels (a) and (b) and \\widetilde{\\beta}_2 and \\widetilde{\\beta}_3 in panels (c) and (d). The polarization is computed in two ways: from the stable fixed points of Eqs.~- (first column) and from stochastic simulations of the contagion dynamics (second column).\n\n\nYou can view the phenomenon of polarization as a perturbation of two completely disconnected communities, both in a bistable regime. We can see this by the shrinking region of polarization. This phenomenon may be a potential mechanism for the reinforcement of polarization, but is certainly not strong enough to spontaneously create polarization in a social system.\n\n\n\nA phase diagram illustrating how changes with (a) \\epsilon_2 and (b) \\epsilon_3 affect the regions over which polarization can occur. In these diagrams, the upper left region enclosed by each line corresponds to the \\widetilde{\\beta}_2,\\widetilde{\\beta}_3 region in which polarization can occur for given values of \\epsilon_2 and \\epsilon_3, and the remaining area is where polarization does not occur. The boundary lines in panel (a) correspond to \\epsilon_2 = 0, 0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0 with \\epsilon_3 = 1 and the boundary lines in panel (b) correspond to \\epsilon_3=0.95,0.9675,0.975,0.9875,1.0 with \\epsilon_2 = 1.\n\n\nPolarization (and the epidemic threshold, as seen below) is VERY sensitive to unequal community sizes. The phase plot becomes asymmetric and it matters which community holds which opinion. For a large enough disparity in community sizes, certain opinion configurations become untenable.\n\n\n\nA plot of the epidemic threshold \\widetilde{\\beta}_2^c with respect to \\rho predicted with the mean field equations. The line corresponding to \\epsilon_2=0 is the epidemic threshold for the case.\n\n\nA significant contribution in this paper is the development of fast algorithms to sample a modification of the hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM) and the hypergraph Erdös-Rényi models. This is also the first project that I used XGI in earnest and it made the data management, analysis, and visualization SO much easier. Of course I’m biased, but I highly recommend trying it.

    "text": "I’m excited to share that “Hypergraph assortativity: a dynamical systems perspective” with @Juanga_Restrepo is now out in Chaos as part of the Dynamics on Networks with Higher-Order Interactions special issue!.\nAssortativity is the tendency of similar individuals to connect with one another more often than you’d expect if they connected at random. “Similarity” can be in terms of degree, age, sex, and many other attributes.\n\n\n\nAn illustration of disassortative and assortative three-uniform hypergraphs. The color of the nodes indicates their degree, with low-degree nodes on the left and high-degree nodes on the right. For a given degree sequence, the term \\langle k k_1\\rangle_E (the average pairwise product) determines \\rho and on average, (a) hyperedges containing nodes with dissimilar degrees decrease this term leading to disassortative hypergraphs and (b) hyperedges containing nodes of similar degree increase this term leading to assortative hypergraphs.\n\n\nAssortativity in pairwise networks has been well-studied, but what about hypergraphs? There is great work out there quantifying assortativity in hypergraphs, but these definitions often aren’t explicitly related to dynamical processes.\nWe defined the “expansion eigenvalue” and showed that it’s meaningful in the prediction of extinction of epidemics for the hypergraph SIS model. We then used degree-based mean-field theory to approximate this eigenvalue for assortative hypergraphs.\nWe found that for uniform hypergraphs (hyperedges all the same size), we could derive an expression for degree assortativity that was related to the expansion eigenvalue and therefore to a dynamical process, which can be written as\n\\rho=\\frac{\\langle k\\rangle^2 \\langle k k_1\\rangle_E}{\\langle k^2\\rangle^2} - 1.\nBecause this expression is meaningful in the context of dynamical systems, we call this quantity the “dynamical assortativity”.\nWe then used preferential double-edge swaps to increase/decrease the assortativity of empirical datasets. For small assortativity values, our prediction of the expansion eigenvalue matches the actual value closely for small enough assortativity values.\n\n\n\nA comparison of the actual expansion eigenvalue \\lambda (connected triangles) to the first-order approximation of the eigenvalue \\lambda_0 + \\epsilon \\lambda_1 (connected circles) for (a) the configuration model, (b) the tags-ask-ubuntu dataset, (c) the congress-bills dataset, and (d) the Eu-Emails dataset. The square marker denotes the original (\\rho,\\lambda) value of the dataset.\n\n\nWe found sharp transitions in the eigenvalue when rewiring empirical hypergraphs, which may indicate that there’s more structure at play than the degree sequence and the degree-degree mixing structure.\nWe can drastically decrease the eigenvalue by rewiring groups and “kill” epidemics by driving the system below the extinction threshold.\n\n\n\n(a) The solid line with markers denotes the fixed value of \\beta_3 as a fraction of the extinction threshold, \\beta_3/\\beta_3^c. The dashed line indicates \\beta_3/\\beta_3^c=1, below which epidemics are not possible. (b) The epidemic equilibrium (percentage of the population infected) for each hypergraph given the fixed value of \\beta_3. The gray bars indicate the standard deviation at each data point."

We found that the heterogeneity of pairwise and group interactions strongly affects the appearance of “tipping point” behavior and you can find the paper in Chaos or on ArXiV. Deciphering the jargon: A hypergraph is a mathematical structure that allows us to represent not only individual interactions but group interactions as well (Illustration below).\n\n\n\nAn illustration of a hypergraph\n\n\nContagion models are well-studied on pairwise networks, but lately, researchers have been interested in the effect of including group interactions. We know that often ideas or opinions can become viral or die out, depending on whether they reach a “critical mass”. This is often called “tipping point” behavior. A contagion in our study could mean an opinion, a virus, a meme, etc. – just something that you would pass on to your friends or friend groups. See Malcom Gladwell’s book, “The Tipping Point” for some neat examples.\nIacopo Iacopini et al. showed in Simplicial Models of Social Contagion that extending the network SIS model to include group interactions can induce tipping point behavior. We extended this idea to explore the effect of heterogeneity in the contact structure both through individual and group connections. We looked at several different pairwise degree distributions and two different ways to connect nodes in groups of three. We observed that a more heterogeneous contact structure (read: closer to real-world social networks) in your individual connections makes tipping points less likely and more heterogeneity in the number of group connections tends to make tipping points more likely. One way to think about this is that there are two competing infection mechanisms. Pairwise transmissions lead to continuous transitions, whereas group transmissions lead to tipping point behavior. Depending on which of these pathways dominate determines the behavior observed. My code is freely available on Github, there is a press release here and again the article is in Chaos or on ArXiV.

On smaller laptops, space on the keyboard is a premium and yet, smack-dab in the center of prime “finger real estate” is a key that I haven’t used since the last strongly worded email I’ve sent (i.e. never). I’ve tried to put myself in the shoes (or office chairs in this case) of the laptop bigwigs scheming with high-powered teams to construct the optimal keyboard layout. How is the caps-lock key still around? I can see that keyboards can be very helpful for people with physical disabilities – I imagine the strain for those with coordination or muscular limitations where two key presses are close to impossible. Having a “helper” key could be useful to make technology more accessible to people with a wider variety of abilities. I wonder then if instead of making a laptop a tad more accessible if we should go all in and make a completely accessible laptop for someone who needs it. But reality is that everyone is different and each person’s limitation will be different as well so it would potentially be extremely expensive to create a custom laptop tailored to an individual. In addition, often people with disabilities simply want a “normal” life, and keeping something seemingly silly like a caps-lock key can noticeably make someone’s life better though you may not know it."

    "text": "I’m very excited to share that a sole-authored work, “Effect of time-dependent infectiousness on epidemic dynamics”, is now out in Physical Review E! This started as a class project with Ren Stengel in Dan Larremore’s class, “Network Analysis and Modeling.” Over time, this morphed into the work that is currently published.\nThe central question that I answered was “How does adding a variable infection rate affect epidemics?” It turns out that many people have thought about this as well, and I read literature published 20 (!) years ago exploring this fact. I modified the SIR to include n infectious stages (traditionally called the SI^kR model), each stage corresponding to the infection rate at a point in time. It is called the viral load (VL) model for its ability to capture time-dependent transmissibility due to viral load.\n\n\n\nSI^kR model\n\n\nI was able to use a combination of mean-field techniques and the “next-generation matrix” by Diekmann et al. to derive analytical expressions for the reproductive number. I derived this for both static and temporal networks with an arbitrary distribution of infectious rate functions.\nThe reproductive number is exactly as you would expect from the SIR model when you let the infection rate equal the average of the infectious rate function. Here’s a plot of the epidemic extent with respect to the derived reproductive number.\n\n\n\nEpidemic extent with respect to R_0\n\n\nThe VL model, however, strongly affects the time dynamics of how an epidemic unfolds; the time scale of the VL model is much shorter than the SIR model.\n\n\n\nThe epidemic trajectories of different contagion models\n\n\nIn addition, the infection propagates as a traveling wave of infection, which we demonstrate with numerical simulations and writing the VL model as a transport equation PDE with infectious boundary conditions.\n\n\n\nThe number of individuals infected for duration τ at time t for the configuration model (top) and the activity model (middle). The line plots (bottom) denote the probability distribution of τ at times 40, 60, and 80, which correspond to normalized vertical cross sections of I(t, \\tau).\n\n\nThis project was especially significant for me as a researcher, because this paper helped me develop my voice. I am grateful to the reviewers for helping me strengthen the idea. A big shoutout to Ren Stengel, Dan Larremore, Juan G. Restrepo, and Subekshya Bidari for their help and input!"

    "text": "Comparing the epidemic extent for different choices of network data for the Project 90 data set. (a) A network visualization of the Project 90 data set. (b) The SI model simulated on the Project 90 data.\n\n\nMy paper with jimi adams, “On limitations of uniplex networks for modeling multiplex contagion” was published in PLoS ONE (Preprint here)! A thread by jimi:\n\nSome years ago, I noticed an apparent growing trend of increasing precision, about (narrower?) behaviors/relationships in network data collection, (especially in studies of STIs - e.g., studies of sex OR needle sharing). Yet, when writing my “little green book” on network data collection (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/gathering-social-network-data/book260973), I became more and more intrigued by the fact that social network analysis initially was very multiplex in focus, and the focus on single ties at a time really came later.\nI definitely think there are benefits to this focus (e.g., the need for domain expertise to improve data quality, etc.). But I also recognize that some of the ways such data are used don’t always consistently matchup to the theoretical topics of interest. The aim was to demonstrate when this “decomposed” data approach “adds up” to the full process of interest, and when it does not. But, I had way too many irons in the fire, so I back-burnered the idea, hoping to loop back at some point.\nAfter encountering a talk & paper by @nwlandry I thought we could make my paper idea happen. I reached out to see if he’d be interested. He was, and took the lead from there.\nSo the paper 1. takes a multiplex network & simulates a diffusion process over it, then 2. decomposes that network into its uniplex layers & runs a diffusion process over each of those separately, then 3. compares the union of simulations in (2) to the results in (1). [4/n]\nBottom line RQ: If we put these constituent pieces (as are available from studies of each tie type separately) back together, do we “recover” the full diffusion extent?”\nWe do this separately for 1. a behavioral network w/ a “simple” contagion process (i.e., an STI), and 2. an (online) social network for a “complex” contagion process (i.e., “an idea”). (Here, think of studying ideas spreading, but focusing on a single platform at a time.)\nWe find that combining the results from the 2 uniplex network contagion processes doesn’t align w/ their respective multiplex networks. In the simple contagion, the union epidemic extent is LESS than for the corresponding multiplex network. In the complex contagion, the union diffusion extent is GREATER than for the corresponding multiplex network. I see the big takeaway as we should reconsider whether this focus on data precision is an appropriate tradeoff for our theoretical aims.\nCode & links to obtain data used are available here. Thanks again to @nwlandry for pulling this out of my “file drawer” and leading it to the light of day."

    "text": "Over the past 3ish months, I have, in collaboration with some awesome coauthors, published two papers that express some of my thoughts and ideas surrounding the potential of higher-order networks and the limitations of current modeling practices.\nOne is titled “Filtering higher-order datasets” and explores the fact that hypergraphs intrinsically encode interactions at different scales and can be used to tease out scale-dependent connection patterns that typically get aggregated out.\nThe other is titled “The simpliciality of higher-order networks” and was a product of my curiosity on exactly how simplicial datasets were and whether it was possible to quantify that in a meaningful way.\nSome things I found along the way: higher-order networks—especially empirical ones—contain beautiful structure that not only allows us to ask the same questions as for pairwise networks (What are structurally/dynamically important nodes? Can we partition the network into communities? What is the global structure of a network?) but different ones as well.\nFor many studies — my own included — “higher-order” networks mean interactions of sizes two and three. Of course, in many empirical datasets, interactions are of a wide range of sizes. As one includes larger and larger interactions, how does that change the structure of a dataset. I think this is an important question and one that I hope to keep digging into.\nThe other thing that kind of bothered me is that in higher-order network science, there are typically two schools of thought: simplicial complex/computational topology folks and data science hypergraph folks. (This is a parody; the reality of the situation is far more nuanced than this). I hope to try and continue bridging the gap between the hypergraph and simplicial complex worlds and perspectives.\nA collaborator once told me that higher-order networks are interesting because, in contrast to pairwise networks, edges have size, they can overlap, and they can include one another."
