I’m an [Assistant Professor of Biology](https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/nicholas-landry) at the University of Virginia (as well as a courtesy faculty member in the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/nicholas-landry)) and I lead an [interdisciplinary lab](https://landry-lab.github.io/) studying how networks and groups (higher-order interactions) affect the spread of diseases, information, and opinions. I use tools from network science, mathematical modeling, Bayesian inference, and open-source software.

My [portfolio](/portfolio/) is a collection of some projects that I’ve worked on personally, professionally, and academically. For more about me, see my [bio](/pages/about.qmd), [CV](/assets/docs/CV.pdf), or list of [publications](/pages/publications.qmd). You can also take a look at my [blog](/blog/).

* Contagion spread (disease, opinions, etc.)
* Inference of network structure
* Open software

## Recent News

* **June 2025**: I attended [NetSci 2025](https://netsci2025.github.io) in Maastricht, NL, where I organized the [Software and Data for Supporting Network Science](https://netsci.nascol.net/) satellite workshop and presented work on sampling from the hypergraph configuration model. I also handed off the Zachary Karate Club award to [Arash Badie-Modiri](https://vaalit.arash.network). A [photo](/assets/images/zkc_handoff.jpg) of the hand-off.
* **May 2025**: New preprint on the arXiv! ["A Blue Start: A large-scale pairwise and higher-order social network dataset"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11608) in collaboration with [Alyssa Smith](https://asmithh.github.io/), [Ilya Amburg](https://sites.google.com/site/ilyaamburg1/home), [Sagar Kumar](https://www.sagarkumar.net/), and [Brooke Foucault Welles](https://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/)!
* **May 2025**: I taught ["A Practical Guide to Modeling with Higher-order Networks"](https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/ds25/program/minitutorials/) with [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](https://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/) as a minitutorial at the [SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS25)](https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/ds25/) in Denver, CO! I also gave a talk on "Opinion disparity in hypergraphs with community structure: theory and practice".
* **May 2025**: "Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem" is now published in [*npj Complexity*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44260-025-00041-3)!
* **April 2025**: I was an invited panelist at the [Social Contagions, Artificial Intelligence, and Democracy Workshop](https://contagion-science.virginia.edu/social-contagions-artificial-intelligence-and-democracy-workshop) at UVA.
* **March 2025**: I presented our paper "Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem" at the APS Global Physics Summit in Anaheim, CA.
* **March 2025**: I gave a talk at the Bryn Mawr [Bi-Co Math Colloquium](https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/academic-information/departments-programs/mathematics/seminars-colloquia-conferences/bi-co-math-colloquium).
* **February 2025**: I gave the UVA Statistics Colloquium talk about network reconstruction from data.
* **January 2024**: I became a [courtesy faculty member](https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/nicholas-landry) in the School of Data Science! This will foster many exciting cross-school collaborations.
* **December 2024**: New [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03421) on the structure of effective governance is now posted!
* **November 2024**: I gave a talk in the Statistics Department at Grinnell College.
* **October 2024**: I chatted with the [Quantum Photonics Club](https://www.facebook.com/qpclub1) on Clubhouse about my work on "Reconstructing networks from simple and complex contagions". Listen to it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NLksRqe2Kw).
