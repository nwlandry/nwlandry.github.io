I’m a new [Assistant Professor of Biology](https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/nicholas-landry) at the University of Virginia. I'm starting an [interdisciplinary lab](https://landry-lab.github.io/) focused on understanding how networks and groups (higher-order interactions) affect the spread of diseases, information, and opinions. I'll be answering these types of questions using tools from network science, mathematical modeling, Bayesian inference, and open-source software. I'm hoping to build bridges between the Biology department, the Biocomplexity Institute, the Quantitative Collaborative, and the School of Data Science, among others. 

**I'll be hiring a postdoc, so stay tuned for an official job posting!**

My [portfolio](/portfolio/) is a collection of some projects that I’ve worked on personally, professionally, and academically. For more about me, see my [bio](/pages/about.qmd), [CV](/assets/docs/CV.pdf), or list of [publications](/pages/publications.qmd). You can also take a look at my [blog](/blog/).
