I’m an [Assistant Professor of Biology](https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/nicholas-landry) at the University of Virginia (as well as a courtesy faculty member in the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/nicholas-landry)) and I lead an [interdisciplinary lab](https://landry-lab.github.io/) studying how networks and groups (higher-order interactions) affect the spread of diseases, information, and opinions. I use tools from network science, mathematical modeling, Bayesian inference, and open-source software.

My [portfolio](/portfolio/) is a collection of some projects that I’ve worked on personally, professionally, and academically. For more about me, see my [bio](/pages/about.qmd), [CV](/assets/docs/CV.pdf), or list of [publications](/pages/publications.qmd). You can also take a look at my [blog](/blog/).

## Recent News

* **December 2025**: New article published! [HIF: The hypergraph interchange format for higher-order networks](https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2025.10018) out in Network Science!
* **November 2025**: I gave a talk titled "A Practical Guide to Higher-Order Networks" at [Datapalooza](https://datascience.virginia.edu/pages/datapalooza)
* **October 2025**: Laurent Hébert-Dufresne and I wrote a news article for SIAM News on doing group science with XGI. Read it [here](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-news/articles/group-science-the-open-source-study-of-higher-order-networks-with-xgi/)!
* **September 2025**: New article published! [Stochastic diffusion with approximate master equations with mean-field limits](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.250726) out in Royal Society Open Science!
* **July 2025**: [Correction](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-025-00557-7) to [The simpliciality of higher-order networks](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00458-1) posted! TL;DR: Small denominator issue kindly pointed out by François Théberge which was corrected for notational consistency, but doesn't change the conclusions of the article.
* **July 2025**: I spent a week at [Mountain Lake Biological Station](https://mlbs.virginia.edu/), working on a project with Charlotte Greene.
* **July 2025**: New preprint on the arXiv! ["HIF: The hypergraph interchange format for higher-order networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11520) in collaboration with Martín Coll, Cliff A. Joslyn, Nicholas W. Landry, Quintino Francesco Lotito, Audun Myers, Joshua Pickard, Brenda Praggastis, Przemysław Szufel! We introduce a standard for sharing higher-order network data between software packages, research projects, and groups!
* **June 2025**: I attended [NetSci 2025](https://netsci2025.github.io) in Maastricht, NL, where I organized the [Software and Data for Supporting Network Science](https://netsci.nascol.net/) satellite workshop and presented work on sampling from the hypergraph configuration model. I also handed off the Zachary Karate Club award to [Arash Badie-Modiri](https://vaalit.arash.network). A [photo](/assets/images/zkc_handoff.jpg) of the hand-off.
