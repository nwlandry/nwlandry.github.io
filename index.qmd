I’m an [Assistant Professor of Biology](https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/nicholas-landry) at the University of Virginia (as well as a courtesy faculty member in the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/nicholas-landry)) and I lead an [interdisciplinary lab](https://landry-lab.github.io/) studying how networks and groups (higher-order interactions) affect the spread of diseases, information, and opinions. I use tools from network science, mathematical modeling, Bayesian inference, and open-source software.

My [portfolio](/portfolio/) is a collection of some projects that I’ve worked on personally, professionally, and academically. For more about me, see my [bio](/pages/about.qmd), [CV](/assets/docs/CV.pdf), or list of [publications](/pages/publications.qmd). You can also take a look at my [blog](/blog/).
