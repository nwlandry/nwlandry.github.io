I have long been a fan of Christian Bok's work [Eunoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunoia_(book)) and I was inpired to write math-themed poems that are vowel-constrained. Technically, I shouldn't be including the letter **y**, but I've allowed myself that creative license - it was hard enough as it was.

## A
Math acts as a canvas,\
Draws abstract art and stands back.\
Talk arcs as far as an arctan can.\
That's a fact: sans daft "facts"\
Math can adapt.

## E
Hypernets deftly represent every extreme\
Vertex, edge, set, hyperdegree...\
They keep three-peer effects, seen by sets.\
We tether the sphere by dense webs.\
Meets end; delete edges.\
Detect schemes between dependent types,\
Lest we never see the energy between these essences.

## I
Limits ill fit digits, I insist.\
Nil, infinity, it is tricky.\
I think whilst spilt ink drips.\
I sigh, digging in with lips tight.\
I find intrinsic inklings within\
Hinting I'm limiting it.\
Thinking, inklings irk.\
I finish, piling my scribblings in mini bins.

## O
Lots of moot log-log plots fool bots.\
Topology's hot - hosts of tools from homology open doors.\
Mod two ops for low-cost loops\
Tools for droll proofs show strong pros or lots of goofs?\
Work's too wobbly to hold. Oops. Poof.\
Good work lost on trolls.

## U
Just crunch sums\
Slurm stuck but Ubuntu runs\
Hunt: bugs turn up\
NULL...nuts! (cuss)\
Dumb luck trumps gutsy truth bursts\
Push/pull; full Chung-Lu runs\
Must numb num crunch.\
