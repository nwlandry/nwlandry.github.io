#  - excerpt: I’m an applied math PhD student with a penchant for thinking about the "why" with a good grounding in common sense. I am analytical and like to see the bigger picture. I’ve worked in both academia and industry and am passionate about the next hard problem that comes my way. I love learning and my portfolio shows some projects that I’ve worked on professionally, in research, and for fun.
