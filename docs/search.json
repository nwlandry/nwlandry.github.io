    "section": "",
    "text": "<img src=“{{”/assets/images/hypergraph_illustration.svg” | absolute_url }}” width=“50%” hspace=“20” align=“left”>\nContagion models are well-studied on pairwise networks, but lately, researchers have been interested in the effect of including group interactions. We know that often ideas or opinions can become viral or die out, depending on whether they reach a “critical mass”. This is often called “tipping point” behavior. A contagion in our study could mean an opinion, a virus, a meme, etc. – just something that you would pass on to your friends or friend groups. See Malcom Gladwell’s book, “The Tipping Point” for some neat examples. Iacopo Iacopini et al. showed in Simplicial Models of Social Contagion that extending the network SIS model to include group interactions can induce tipping point behavior. We extended this idea to explore the effect of heterogeneity in the contact structure both through individual and group connections. We looked at several different pairwise degree distributions and two different ways to connect nodes in groups of three. We observed that a more heterogeneous contact structure (read: closer to real-world social networks) in your individual connections makes tipping points less likely and more heterogeneity in the number of group connections tends to make tipping points more likely. One way to think about this is that there are two competing infection mechanisms. Pairwise transmissions lead to continuous transitions, whereas group transmissions lead to tipping point behavior. Depending on which of these pathways dominate determines the behavior observed. My code is freely available on Github, there is a press release here and again the article is in Chaos or on ArXiV.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Something I’ve come to feel strongly about is the unnecessary nature of the caps-lock key. On smaller laptops, space on the keyboard is a premium and yet, smack-dab in the center of prime “finger real estate” is a key that I haven’t used since the last strongly worded email I’ve sent (i.e. never). I’ve tried to put myself in the shoes (or office chairs in this case) of the laptop bigwigs scheming with high-powered teams to construct the optimal keyboard layout. How is the caps-lock key still around? I can see that keyboards can be very helpful for people with physical disabilities – I imagine the strain for those with coordination or muscular limitations where two key presses are close to impossible. Having a “helper” key could be useful to make technology more accessible to people with a wider variety of abilities. I wonder then if instead of making a laptop a tad more accessible if we should go all in and make a completely accessible laptop for someone who needs it. But reality is that everyone is different and each person’s limitation will be different as well so it would potentially be extremely expensive to create a custom laptop tailored to an individual. In addition, often people with disabilities simply want a “normal” life, and keeping something seemingly silly like a caps-lock key can noticeably make someone’s life better though you may not know it."

    "text": "The central question that I answered was “How does adding a variable infection rate affect epidemics?” It turns out that many people have thought about this as well, and I read literature published 20 (!) years ago exploring this fact. I modified the SIR to include n infectious stages (traditionally called the SI^kR model), each stage corresponding to the infection rate at a point in time. It is called the viral load (VL) model for its ability to capture time-dependent transmissibility due to viral load.\n<img src=“{{”/assets/images/time-dependent-infectiousness/model.png” | absolute_url }}” width=“50%” hspace=“20” align=“left”>\nI was able to use a combination of mean-field techniques and the “next-generation matrix” by Diekmann et al. to derive analytical expressions for the reproductive number. I derived this for both static and temporal networks with an arbitrary distribution of infectious rate functions.\nThe reproductive number is exactly as you would expect from the SIR model when you let the infection rate equal the average of the infectious rate function. Here’s a plot of the epidemic extent with respect to the derived reproductive number.\n<img src=“{{”/assets/images/time-dependent-infectiousness/extent_vs_R0.png” | absolute_url }}” width=“50%” hspace=“20” align=“left”>\nThe VL model, however, strongly affects the time dynamics of how an epidemic unfolds; the time scale of the VL model is much shorter than the SIR model.\n<img src=“{{”/assets/images/time-dependent-infectiousness/infection_curves.png” | absolute_url }}” width=“50%” hspace=“20” align=“left”>\nIn addition, the infection propagates as a traveling wave of infection, which we demonstrate with numerical simulations and writing the VL model as a transport equation PDE with infectious boundary conditions.\n<img src=“{{”/assets/images/time-dependent-infectiousness/heatmap.png” | absolute_url }}” width=“50%” hspace=“20” align=“left”>\nThis project was especially significant for me as a researcher, because this paper helped me develop my voice.

    "text": "This project began when I was thinking about how as humans, we have an intuitive sense of structure in music. We can tell what a chorus sounds like and we often can tell what we think should come next. So I wondered, what does dissonance or consonance in music “look” like? Can compositions be visualized in a meaningful way to an observer? What makes the Beatles the Beatles, or Stravinsky so distinct? Can we visualize the nuances that different orchestras or performers bring to the same piece? Can each musical composition be expressed as a visual “fingerprint” that tells us more about the performers and composers?\n\nMy goal became visualizing music in a way that makes sense musically, mathematically, and artistically as sculpture or image. My premise was that music can be visualized in such a way that distinctive features we hear in a composition are also apparent in a visual representation; that the inherent structure of compositions can be embodied as form, color, texture, and light.\nMuch work has been devoted to expressing musical pieces as line structures (The Shape of Song, Narrative 2.0, and so on) and - one of my favorites - as a genre map. However, the area of sculpture has been left largely untouched (Though look at this neat example).\nThe motivation for this project was to make music more accessible and more tangible to those who haven’t developed a love for music, yet also rigorous enough to satisfy those with a knowledge of music theory and composition."

    "text": "Introduction\n\n\n\nDifferent contexts in which music can be described\n\n\nThere are many approaches that can be taken when classifying or describing music. Something to remember is that music is inherently perceptual and any study of the structure of music should keep this in mind. One can classify and describe music in a variety of valid ways. One can consider the cultural impact of the music (think of the Beatles), the perception of the artist, the physical medium that we buy (record, CD, file, with its associated art and meta-data), or the raw audio file itself. Considering any category in isolation may provide incomplete information on what exactly we consider that piece of music to be. I chose to look at the raw audio and analyze it because the act of listening is when we notice music’s structure."

    "text": "Ideas\nEven when looking at the raw audio, there are a variety of approaches. One can distill the audio file into a long list of statistics (average energy, zero crossing rate, the distribution of the frequencies, etc.), look at its structural makeup (i.e. ABACABA form; Bridge, Verse, Chorus), or use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequencies. I decided to use the FFT to describe the song because the spectrum at a given time provides a lot of information and we can scaffold other methods on top of this initial analysis.\n\n\n\nDifferent types of methods for analyzing audio data\n\n\nI broke the audio into overlapping windows, or frames, as they are called (see below). There are standards for the size of the frames and the amount of overlap between frames (See Music Similarity and Retrieval). When you look at a frame of the audio file, it’s important to apply a Hamming filter, which forces the sample to be periodic, no matter where the frame starts or stops. This is needed to get rid of artifacts in the FFT computation, however, it removes information at the beginning and end of the frame, which is why overlap (“hop” in standard terminology) between frames is a best practice.\n\n\n\nOverview for how I parsed through each audio file\n\n\nRecall that music is inherently a perceptual medium and so, we, as humans, do not perceive sound absolutely, but rather, relatively. The mel scale was developed to captured to account for the non-linear way in which we perceive relative pitch and the sone and phon scales capture how we perceive loudness depending on the pitch.\n\n\n\nRelative scales for pitch and loudness\n\n\nFrom the frequency spectrum that I computed for each frame, I computed the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) which are defined most simply as the frequency of the log frequencies relative to the Mel scale described above. Here’s a visual of the process of computing MFCCs:\n\n\n\nProcess (Steps 1-5) for computing the MFCCs of a frame"

First, I computed the FFT for each frame and created a contour plot of frequencies vs. time (This is known as the short-time Fourier transform or STFT).

Second, I plotted the first and second components of the MFCC as a scatter plot.\n\nRock Music\nHere’s an example from U2’s “American Soul”, a bombastic rock anthem (Wow, this sounds like a review!

Oftentimes, processes like cold rolling, milling, stamping, forging, etc. are used not only to achieve the desired shape, but also the desired strength. Desirable traits could be stiffness, high fatigue strength, flexibility, or other application specific characteristics. Microstructure Sensitive Design (MSD) is the process by which you achieve material properties by a sequence of forming operations. Unfortunately, metal forming simulations that account for and keep track of the microstructure are extremely computationally expensive, so typically, simulations are run on extremely small “samples”. My project was to see how much the microstructure data could be reduced while maintaining sufficient simulation accuracy."

If we express each orientation as a vector of Fourier coefficients, we can exploit the linearity of the Fourier space.
